# tic-tac-toe-game
3/15/2020:
My first Python and coding project! A tic tac toe game I made. No UI, just text based.
If someone tries it out, let me know how I can improve the cleanliness of the code and of any bugs present.

3/17/2020 UPDATE:
With "tic-tac-toe-2.py", I added two more gamemodes (Player vs. Player and Bot vs. Bot) and cleaned up the code and made it
a bit drier. I think this might be it for this project, unless if I decide to revisit it maybe to make the bot smarter.
